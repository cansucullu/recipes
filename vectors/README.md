I had to draw some vectors in the cartesian coordinate system, for a
data storytelling project of my own, just like we used to draw by hand
on the blackboard/whiteboard since the middle school years.

The snippet uses Python's [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library.

The official
[Matplotlib examples](https://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html) does
not have a good example except for
[this](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/arrow_simple_demo.html)
which could be used as a starting point.

Afterwards, I found some more examples:
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12265234/how-to-plot-2d-math-vectors-with-matplotlib
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42281966/how-to-plot-vectors-in-python-using-matplotlib
* https://hyunyoung2.github.io/2017/05/16/How_To_Plot_Vector_And_Plane_With_Python/

But, none of them was like the one I used to draw during my math studies with pen and paper.

I have decided to create a snippet of my own. And here is the result!

I tried to make it as customizable as possible. I hope you enjoy and
make use of it.
