Recently for a visualization project of my own, I had to draw some vectors in the cartesian coordinate system, just like we used to draw by hand since middle school.

Python is my go to address for these kind of stuff. And in Python the wonderful library [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) could well do the job.

Having searched through the official [Matplotlib examples](https://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html) I couldn't find a good example except for [this](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/arrow_simple_demo.html) starting point.

Then, I have checked the open source community and found some more examples:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12265234/how-to-plot-2d-math-vectors-with-matplotlib
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42281966/how-to-plot-vectors-in-python-using-matplotlib
- https://hyunyoung2.github.io/2017/05/16/How_To_Plot_Vector_And_Plane_With_Python/

But, none of them was like the one I used to draw during my math studies with pen and paper.

Finally, I have decided to create a snippet of my own. And here is the result!

I have tried to make it as customizable as possible. I hope you enjoy and make use of it. Feel free to take it further.
