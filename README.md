# Recipes

This repository contains scripts, small programs and code snippets that I have created for solving various tasks from various projects. This place is a reference for my future self, as well as a container for my humble efforts to support Open Source movement, from which I have benefited a lot over the years.

As having an educational background in industrial engineering and work experience in data science &mdash;as opposed to software engineering or computer science&mdash; I have utilized Python for all my programming related needs. And there was not any time that I was stuck for trying to solve my tasks using Python. Hence, in most cases, this repository will contain Python scripts.
