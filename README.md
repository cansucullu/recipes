# Recipes

This repository contains scripts, small programs and code snippets that
I created for solving various tasks in various projects. This place is a
reference for my future self, as well as my humble contribution to the
Open Source community which helped me in valuable ways during my early
days especially during writing my master's thesis.

It's mostly Python.

Enjoy!
